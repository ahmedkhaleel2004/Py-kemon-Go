# Py-kemon-Go

Fully functioning, balanced, and enjoyable version of Pokemon Go built using a command line Python GUI.

This game uses the `keyboard` module, which if you do not have, it will prompt you to automatically install it upon running.

Note: This program uses ANSI codes for formatting and therefore, it is pretty much only playable in apps that support it, like VSCode's terminal. Running this in IDLE or the terminal will look very bad.
